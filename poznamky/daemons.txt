 --> like when a HTTP server listens on port 80
 --> the names in 'd'  --> sshd, httpd

Systemd, systemctl, journalctl  -> daemon for service (daemon) management

>sudo systemctl start sshd    # start a ssh server
>ssh intro@localhost          # conncet to it
>sudo systemctl status sshd   # status
>sudo systemctl stop sshd     # stop it
>journalctl -u sshd    # see log of sshd
