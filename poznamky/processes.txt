Processes
- process = running program
- both share the code, but a process also contains the stack, heap,
  list of opened files etc.

View processes
- htop  --> view basic properties of running processes  (~task manager)
- ps    --> process status --> find out shell PID
- ps -e, ps -auxfw (more detail) --> non-interactive
- ps -e --forest    --> --forest depicts the parent/child relationships
- ps -ef   --> full = full name + processes of all users
    --> every user can see processes of other users --> including cmd-line args
    --> never pass passwords as command-line arguments, but through files

Process ID
- PID 1 is used by the first process in the system, which is always running. 
- PID 0 is reserved as a special value â€“ see fork(2) --> not used by any process
- processes are assigned their PIDs incrementally and PIDs are eventually reused.
- /proc/   --> a dir with all processes --> ps reads info from here

Killing processes
- sleep 600
- pgrep sleep  --> 21472
- pgrep 600    -->       --> pgrep looks only for the program name (sleep)
- pgrep -f 600 --> 21472 --> looks for full name = the whole command line
- kill PID   --> kills the procces with PID
- kill -9 PID  --> some processes do not terminate with kill 
               --> kill -9 tells the OS to be more forceful
- user can always kill his own processes but not anyone elses
