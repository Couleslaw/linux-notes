> find -name alpha.txt   # finds all alpha.txt files in ./ and all subdirs

   --> {} will be replaces with filename, ; terminates commnads, so it is escaped

find -options-for-find | while read filename; do
    do_some_complicated_things_with "$filename"
done
--> unsafe in filenames have ' ' or '\n' in them

find src -type f -name '*.md' -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d $'\0' filename; do
    build_markdown_page "$filename"
done
--> works every time
