Exit codes
- a way of checking wheather a program terminated correctly or not
- 0 = success, non-zero = error
- the exit code of the last run command is in $?

Pipelines 
- the success of a pipeline is determined by its last command
    --> sort /nonexistent | head     is successful
- set -o pipefail    --> failure of any cmd fails the whole pipeline

Python
- unless specified otherwise with sys.exit(), the exit code is always zero

C
- the int main function returns the exit code
